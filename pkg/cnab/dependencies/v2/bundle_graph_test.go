/*
âœ… need to represent new dependency structure on an extended bundle wrapper
(put in cnab-go later)

need to read a bundle and make a BundleGraph
? how to handle a param that isn't a pure assignment, e.g. connstr: ${bundle.deps.VM.outputs.ip}:${bundle.deps.SVC.outputs.port}
? when are templates evaluated as the graph is executed (for simplicity, first draft no composition / templating)

need to resolve dependencies in the graph
* lookup against existing installations
* lookup against semver tags in registry
* lookup against bundle index? when would we look here? (i.e. preferred/registered implementations of interfaces)

need to turn the sorted nodes into an execution plan
execution plan needs:
* bundle to execute and the installation it will become
* parameters and credentials to pass
  * sources:
 	root parameters/creds
	installation outputs

need to write something that can run an execution plan
* knows how to grab sources and pass them into the bundle
