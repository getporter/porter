# Porter Project Goveranance

This document outlines how the Porter project governs itself. The Porter project
consists of the repositories in the https://github.com/getporter
organization. 

Everyone who interacts with the project must abide by our [Code of Conduct]. 

## Legal

The Porter project is in the [CNCF Sandbox](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/). â›±

## Roles

We have a [Contribution Ladder] that explains the capabilities and
responsibilities of each role on the project. The ladder includes the
requirements necessary to "move up the ladder" and attain each role such as:

* Contributor
* Maintainer
* Emeritus Maintainer
* Admin

The [OWNERS.md] file defines the maintainers of the project.

## Release Process

Maintainers create the next release when the main branch is stable and related
groupings of work is complete. We have a loose cadence, and strive to hit a release 
every three (3) months.

Releases are done by creating a [new release](https://github.com/getporter/porter/releases/new)
This will trigger the Github Action Pipelines to build and publish the new release to Github and 
the Website. After this is done, we update the [CNCF Slack Channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/) (#porter) & [Mailing List](https://groups.io/g/porter). 

## Issue Response Timeline

Porter is taken care of by maintainers and contributors who volunteer their time.
We aim to **respond** to issues within five (5) business days.

## Roadmap

Our [Roadmap] is determined by where our maintainers have decided to volunteer
their time. We try to keep it up-to-date so that the community can see where the
project is headed but it is not a commitment.
