## Search

Porter maintains lists for mixins and plugins available for users to install.
These can be searched via [porter mixins search](/cli/porter_mixins_search/) or
[porter plugins search](/cli/porter_plugins_search/).

For example, here we search for mixins with the term `az` in the name:

```console
$ porter mixin search az
Name   Description                    Author           URL                                     URL Type
az     A mixin for using the az cli   Porter Authors   https://cdn.porter.sh/mixins/atom.xml   Atom Feed
```

If no query is supplied, the full listing will be returned.

For example, here we search for all plugins, specifying `yaml` output:

```console
$ porter plugin search -o yaml
- name: azure
  author: Porter Authors
  description: Integrate Porter with Azure. Store Porter's data in Azure Cloud and
    secure your bundle's secrets in Azure Key Vault.
  url: https://cdn.porter.sh/plugins/atom.xml

```
