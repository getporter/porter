Integrate Porter with Azure Cloud.

Source: https://github.com/getporter/azure-plugins

## Install or Upgrade

```
porter plugin install azure
```

Note that the v1 release of the plugin only works with Porter v1.0.0-alpha.20 and higher.

## Plugin Configuration

### Secrets

Secrets plugins allow Porter to store and resolve sensitive bundle data.

For example, to resolve a database password, if your team has a shared key vault that has the password stored in it, you
can use the keyvault plugin to inject it as a credential when you install a bundle.
Another usecase is to store any sensitive bundle parameters and outputs. For
example, if a bundle depends on a redis bundle to generate a database connection
string as an output, the connection string will be securely stored in the key
vault.

#### Key Vault

The `azure.keyvault` plugin resolves credentials against secrets in Azure Key Vault.

1. Open, or create, `~/.porter/config.yaml`
1. Add the following lines to activate the Azure keyvault secrets plugin:

    ```yaml
    default-secrets: "mysecrets"
    
    secrets:
      name: "mysecrets"
      plugin: "azure.keyvault"
      config:
        vault: "myvault"
    ```
1. [Create a key vault][keyvault] and set the vault name in the config with name of the vault.
1. [Create a service principal][sp] and create an Access Policy on the vault giving Get and List secret permissions.
1. Using credentials for the service principal set the environment variables: `AZURE_TENANT_ID`,`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`,  and `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`.
