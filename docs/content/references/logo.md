Meet Michelle, the Porter Cat! She has traveled the world to see how people are
deploying software, and now she's here to help you use Porter to bundle your
deployments. üß≥üåç 

## Origin Story

Michelle is named after the intrepid [Michelle Noorali] who is
one of the creators of the Cloud Native Application Bundle ([CNAB])
specification and the original implementation [Duffle]. Duffle eventually became
the foundation for everyone's CNAB runtime, including Porter's, when it
converted its code into a reusable library for everyone to use with [cnab-go].
Since Michelle helped welcome and inspire so many of us to work with bundles, we
wanted to honor her work getting this ecosystem started by naming our friendly
Porter Cat after her.

## Styleguide

Here are some hints on how to use the logo and Porter brand and ensure that the
colors and font are consistent, the logo does not look blurry, and of course
everything looks darn cute.

All of our art assets are in our [community repository in the art/][art] directory.
That's the best place to get a copy of any picture that you need to work with.
If you aren't sure about a picture that you need, or how to use it, [contact us]
and we'd be happy to help out.

### Image Formats

Our repository has multiple image formats for each image, the original SVG and a
PNG. When you need to resize an image, it will look best if you can open an SVG
file from the repository, resize it, and then export it to the image format that
you need. When a PNG is resized, especially a large amount, the resulting image
becomes fuzzy.

### Logo

We have a few versions of the logo depending on the space and layout constraints.

## Porter Cat


![Je Suis Porter Cat: Yellow cat standing and waving, wearing a red bellhop hat and bowtie. Underneath is a picture of the cat's face saying "your bundles are packed!". To the side is a repeat of the guidelines below for drawing the Porter Cat mascot](https://github.com/getporter/community/raw/main/art/styleguide/porter-cat-overview.png)

### Guidelines for Drawing Porter Cat

When drawing the Porter cat, follow these set of guidelines:

**Simple Shape**

The character should have just enough detail to make them out. The smaller they
get, the less detail they can have to avoid crowding. The attributes
should be prioritized by number rank. A smaller porter cat should have ears and
a hat. Torso could be omitted.

**Noodle Arms**

Think Adventure Time or Cyanide and Happiness. Limbs should be easy to position
and use in action poses (no fingers or sharp joints).

**Is A Cat**

1. Ears
2. Tail
3. Whiskers

**Is A Porter**

1. Hat
2. Bowtie
3. Accessories

The tail should curve up towards the head, so that it points up in an opposing
arc away from the arms. Avoid crossing the tail and arms if possible.

### Scaling Porter Cat

![The Porter Cat pushing a gold luggage cart carrying the CNAB logo. Pictures of the Porter Cat icon at various small sizes: 64px-16px. Porter Cat holding a code terminal saying "Here's a mixin!"](https://github.com/getporter/community/raw/main/art/styleguide/porter-cat-examples.png)

When the logo needs to be scaled way down, the line-drawing border needs to
lighten. At a certain point (say 20px) the border should be dropped for this
simplified rendering (favicon). You can also represent Porter Cat using the 
[cat face emoji] üê± in your blog posts and on social media.
