title: Distribute a Mixin
description: How to distribute a mixin for others to install and use
---

Once you have created a mixin, it is time to share it with others so that
they can try it out and use it too. Porter has built-in commands for
managing mixins. All you need to do is get your mixin ready, and publish
them to a file server:

* [Prepare](#prepare)
* [Publish](#publish)
* [Install](#install)
* [Search](#search)

## Prepare

Your mixin should be compatible with the following architectures and operating
systems:

* GOOS: windows, linux, darwin
* GOARCH: amd64

If you are creating your mixin in Go, you may find the [Makefile][mk] that we use
for our Porter mixins helpful as a starting point.

## Publish

Porter expects mixins to be published with a specific naming convention:

* client: `VERSION/MIXIN-GOOS-GOARCH[FILE-EXT]`
* runtime: `VERSION/MIXIN-linux-amd64`

\* Note: Porter uses `GOOS` and `GOARCH` which are terms from the Go programming
language, because it is written in Go. You must use the same terms, for example
`darwin` and not macos, in order to Porter to recognize your mixin properly.

Here is an example from the exec mixin:

```
base url/
└── v0.4.0-ralpha.1+dubonnet
    ├── exec-darwin-amd64
    ├── exec-linux-amd64
    └── exec-windows-amd64.exe
```

If you are distributing your mixing via Github releases, upload just the mixin
executables as artifacts to a release named after the mixin version, and it will
match exactly what Porter expects. Then provide the following URL to your users,
`https://github.com/org/project/releases/download`.

## Install

When porter installs a mixin, it builds a url from the command-line arguments:

```
porter mixin install NAME --version VERSION --url URL
```

* client url: `URL/VERSION/NAME-GOOS-GOARCH[FILE_EXT]`
* runtime url: `URL/VERSION/NAME-linux-amd64`

When `--version` is not specified, it is defaulted to `latest` which should
represent the most recent version of the mixin.

You may also choose to publish `canary` versions of the mixin, which are
unpublished builds from the "main" branch. The official Porter mixins follow
this pattern. If you have other published tagged builds of your mixin, porter
can handle installing them as well.

## Search

See the [Search Guide][search-guide] on how to search for available mixins and/or
add your own to the list.
