Integrate Porter with Azure Cloud.

Source: https://github.com/getporter/azure-plugins

## Install or Upgrade

```
porter plugin install azure
```

## Plugin Configuration

### Storage

Storage plugins allow Porter to store data, such as installation data and
credentials or parameters, in Azure cloud.

#### Blob

The `azure.blob` plugin stores data in Azure Blob Storage. 

1. Open, or create, `~/.porter/config.toml`.
1. Add the following line to activate the Azure blob storage plugin:

    ```toml
    default-storage-plugin = "azure.blob"
    ```

1. [Create a storage account][account]
1. [Create a container][container] named `porter`.
1. [Copy the connection string][connstring] for the storage account. Then set it as an environment variable named 
    `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`.

### Secrets

Secrets plugins allow Porter to inject secrets into credential sets.

For example, if your team has a shared key vault with a database password, you
can use the keyvault plugin to inject it as a credential when you install a bundle.

#### Key Vault

The `azure.keyvault` plugin resolves credentials against secrets in Azure Key Vault.

1. Open, or create, `~/.porter/config.toml`
1. Add the following lines to activate the Azure keyvault secrets plugin:

    ```toml
    default-secrets = "mysecrets"
    
    [[secrets]]
    name = "mysecrets"
    plugin = "azure.keyvault"
    
    [secrets.config]
    vault = "myvault"
    ```
1. [Create a key vault][keyvault] and set the vault name in the config with name of the vault.
1. [Create a service principal][sp] and create an Access Policy on the vault giving Get and List secret permissions.
1. Using credentials for the service principal set the environment variables: `AZURE_TENANT_ID`,`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`,  and `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`.
