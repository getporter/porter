Integrate Porter with Hashicorp Vault.

Source: https://github.com/dev-drprasad/porter-hashicorp-plugins

## Install or Upgrade

Supports Porter version greater or equal to **v1.0.0-alpha.20**.
Until the upstream plugin is updated to work with Porter v1, this is a [special release] with compatibility fixes.
For older versions of Porter, use version v0.1.0 of the hashicorp plugin.
We only support the [KV Version 2][kv-v2] secret engine. Please raise an issue if you're looking for support for other secret engines.

```
porter plugin install hashicorp --version v0.1.0-porter.1 --url https://github.com/getporter/hashicorp-plugins/releases/download
```

[special release]: https://github.com/getporter/hashicorp-plugins/releases/tag/v0.1.0-porter.1
[kv-v2]: https://www.vaultproject.io/api-docs/secret/kv/kv-v2

## Plugin Configuration

To use vault plugin, add the following config to porter's config file (default location: `~/.porter/config.toml`). Replace `vault_addr`, `vault_token` and `path_prefix` with proper values.

The example below retrieves the vault_token from the VAULT_TOKEN environment variable.
Do not store sensitive data in the Porter configuration file.

```toml
default-secrets = "porter-secrets"

[[secrets]]
  name = "porter-secrets"
  plugin = "hashicorp.vault"

  [secrets.config]
    vault_addr = "http://vault.example.com:7500"
    path_prefix = "organization/team/project"
    vault_token = "${env.VAULT_TOKEN}"
```

## Config Parameters
#### path_prefix

`path_prefix` allows you to specify a prefix for your secret path.
Let's say you have a secret (`myawesomeproject`) with path `organization/team/project/myawesomeproject`, then you can configure `path_prefix` as `organization/team/project`.

#### porter_secret

You can optionally change where Porter saves secrets by setting `porter_secret`.
By default, Porter generated secrets are saved to PATH_PREFIX/SECRET_KEY/porter.

#### Secret Organization

The plugin resolves the secret using the secret value set in the Parameter or Credential Set, using the path prefix defined in the Porter configuration file.

```yaml
name: myparameterset
parameters:
  - name: mysql-connection-string
    source:
      secret: myapp/v1/connstr
```

The secret value can use sub-paths to further select the correct secret.
In the example above, the mysql-connection-string parameter resolves to the secret at PATH_PREFIX/myapp/v1/connstr.
