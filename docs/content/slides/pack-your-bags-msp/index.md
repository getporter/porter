## Parameters

Variables in your bundle that you can specify when you execute the bundle
and are loaded into the bundle either as environment variables or files.

### Define a Paramer
```yaml
parameters:
- name: name
  type: string
  default: llama
```

### Use a Parameter
```yaml
- "echo Hello, ${ bundle.parameters.name }
```

* Needs double quotes around the yaml entry
* Needs double curly braces around the templating
* Uses the format `bundle.parameters.PARAMETER_NAME`

???
Explain defaults and when parameters are required

---
## Try it out: Print Your Name

Modify the hello bundle to print "Hello, YOUR NAME", for example "Hello, Aarti", using a parameter.

1. Edit the porter.yaml to define a parameter named `name`.
1. Use the parameter in the `install` action and echo your name.
1. Rebuild your bundle with `porter build`.
1. Finally run `porter install --param name=YOUR_NAME` and look for your name in the output.

---
### porter list

```
$ porter list
NAME          CREATED         MODIFIED        LAST ACTION   LAST STATUS
HELLO_LLAMA   5 seconds ago   3 seconds ago   install       success
HELLO         8 minutes ago   8 minutes ago   install       success
```

---
name: claims
### Claims

Claims are records of any actions performed by CNAB compliant tools on a bundle.

```
$ porter bundle show HELLO
Name: HELLO
Created: 8 minutes ago
Modified: 8 minutes ago
Last Action: install
Last Status: success
```

---
name: cleanup-hello
## Cleanup Hello World

First run `porter uninstall` without any arguments:
```
$ porter uninstall
uninstalling HELLO...
executing porter uninstall configuration from /cnab/app/porter.yaml
Uninstall Hello World
Goodbye World
execution completed successfully!
```

Now run `porter uninstall` with the name you used for the modified bundle:
```
$ porter uninstall HELLO_LLAMA
uninstalling HELLO_LLAMA...
executing porter uninstall configuration from /cnab/app/porter.yaml
Uninstall Hello llama
Goodbye llama
execution completed successfully!
```

---
# Publishing Bundles

Use `porter publish` to share bundles:

* Publishes both the invocation image and the CNAB bundle manifest to an OCI registry.
* Uses Docker tags for both

```yaml
name: HELLO-LLAMA
version: 0.1.0
description: "An example Porter configuration with moar llamas"
tag: "YOURNAME/porter-hello-llama"
```

---
# Modify the bundle

Let's make this bundle yours by changing it from the deislabs Docker Hub registry to your own:

1. Open **porter.yaml**
1. Find the `invocationImage` and the `tag` fields, and then change `deislabs` to your docker username.

    They should now look like this:

    ```yaml
    invocationImage: "YOURNAME/porter-hello-llama:latest"
    tag: "YOURNAME/porter-hello-llama-bundle:latest"
    ```
1. Save and close the file.

---
## porter publish

```
$ porter publish --help
Publishes a bundle by pushing the invocation image and bundle to a registry.


Examples:
  porter publish

```

---
# Try it out: Publish your bundle

```
$ porter publish
```

If you run into trouble here, here are a few things to check:
* Make sure that you updated the invocationImage and tag to use your docker hub username
* Log into docker hub with `docker login`

---
# Try it out: Install the bundle

```
$ porter install --reference YOURNAME/porter-hello-llama:v0.1.0 --param name=YOURNAME
```

## porter credentials generate

```
$ porter credentials generate --help
Generate a named set of credentials.

The first argument is the name of credential set you wish to generate. If not
provided, this will default to the bundle name. By default, Porter will
generate a credential set for the bundle in the current directory. You may also
specify a bundle with --file.

Bundles define 1 or more credential(s) that are required to interact with a
bundle. The bundle definition defines where the credential should be delivered
to the bundle, i.e. at /home/nonroot/.kube. A credential set, on the other hand,
represents the source data that you wish to use when interacting with the
bundle. These will typically be environment variables or files on your local
file system.

When you wish to install, upgrade or delete a bundle, Porter will use the
credential set to determine where to read the necessary information from and
will then provide it to the bundle in the correct location.
```

## Wordpress Credential Mapping

### ~/.porter/credentials/wordpress.yaml

  source:

```

### porter.yaml
```yaml
credentials:

  path: /home/nonroot/.kube/config
```

---
name: hack
exclude: true
### A quick hack

If you are using for Docker for Desktop with Kubernetes

1. Copy $HOME/.kube/config to $HOME/.kube/internal-config
1. Edit **internal-config** and change the server from `localhost` to `host.docker.internal`

```
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    insecure-skip-tls-verify: true
    server: https://host.docker.internal:6443
  name: docker-for-desktop-cluster
```

Specify this config file for `porter credentials generate` on the next slide for the kubeconfig.

---
exclude: true
## Try it out: porter credentials generate

Generate a set of credentials for the wordpress bundle in this repository.

1. Change to the `wordpress` directory under the workshop materials
1. Run `porter build`
1. Run `porter credentials generate` and follow the interactive prompts to create a set of credentials
for the wordpress bundle.

we all do this together

---
exclude: true
## Try it out: porter install --credential-set

Install the wordpress bundle and pass it the named set of credentials that you generated.

```
$ porter install --credential-set wordpress

```

---
## Mixins

Declare any mixins that you are going to use

```yaml
mixins:
  - azure
  - terraform
```

---
name: parameters
## Parameters

Define parameters that the bundle requires.

```yaml
parameters:
  - name: location
    type: string
    default: "EastUS"

  - name: server-name
    type: string

  - name: database-name
    type: string
```

---
name: credentials
## Credentials

Define credentials that the bundle requires and where they should be placed
in the bundle when it is executing:

* environment variables (env)
* files (path)

```yaml
credentials:
  - name: subscription_id
    env: AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID

  - name: tenant_id
    env: AZURE_TENANT_ID

  - name: client_id
    env: AZURE_CLIENT_ID

  - name: client_secret
    env: AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET
```

---
## Credentials

Variables that can be specified when the bundle is executed that are _associated with the identity 
of the user executing the bundle_, and are loaded into the bundle either as environment variables or files.

They are mapped from the local system using named credential sets, instead of specified on the command-line.

---
name: creds-v-params
## Credentials vs. Parameters

### Parameters
* Application Configuration
* Stored in the claim
* üö® Available in **plaintext** on the local filesystem

### Credentials
* Identity of the user executing the bundle
* Is not stored in the claim
* Has to be presented every time you perform an action

---
name: passwords
## Credentials, Passwords and Sensitive Data

* Credentials are for data identifying data associated with a user. They are 
re-specified every time you run a bundle, and are not stored in the claim.
* Parameters can store sensitive data using the `sensitive` flag. This prevents 
the value from being printed to the console.
* We (porter) and the CNAB spec are working on more robust storage mechanisms for 
claims with sensitive data, and better ways to pull data from secret stores so that 
they don't end up on the file system unencrypted.

In all honesty this area is a work in progress. I would shove anything sensitive in a 
credential for now but be aware of the distinction and where the CNAB spec is moving.

---
name: outputs
### Bundle Outputs

Often, a bundle will produce _something_. This might be a new certificate, a hostname, or some other piece of information. Bundle Outputs are used to provide this information back to the CNAB runtime.  

```
outputs:
  - name: STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY
    type: string
```

---
name: outputs
### View Bundle Outputs with Porter

```
$ porter bundle show


Outputs:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

---
name: dockerfile
## Custom Dockerfile

Specify a custom Dockerfile for the invocation image

* Use a different base image
* Add users, tweak the environment and configuration
* Install tools and applications

‚ö†Ô∏è You are responsible for copying files into the bundle into `${BUNDLE_DIR}`

---

### porter.yaml

```yaml
dockerfile: Dockerfile.tmpl
```

### Dockerfile.tmpl

```Dockerfile
FROM debian:stable-slim

ARG BUNDLE_DIR

RUN apt-get install -y curl

COPY myscript.sh ${BUNDLE_DIR}
```

---
exclude: true
## Try it out: Custom Dockerfile

Make a bundle that uses a custom `dockerfile` template and uses **mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cli**
as its base image

1. Create a porter bundle in a new directory with `porter create`.
1. Modify the **porter.yaml** to uncomment out `#dockerfile: Dockerfile.tmpl`.
1. Edit **Dockerfile.tmpl** to use **mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cli** for the base image.
1. Edit the install action to run `az help`.
1. Build the bundle.
1. Install the bundle.

---
## Porter's Default Dockerfile

* Uses Debian for the base image
* Installs root ssl certificates

üé©‚ú® Automatically copies everything into the bundle for you

---
# Actions and Steps

---
## Actions

Actions map to the verbs you use when you use Porter.

* porter install
* porter upgrade
* porter uninstall

These are defined in the CNAB specification. You can also define your own actions and run them

```
$ porter invoke --action myaction
```

---
## Steps

Within an action you can define a series of ordered steps.

* A step must complete successfully before the next step is executed.
* A step is defined using a mixin. Each step can use only one mixin. So far we have
used the `exec` mixin that lets you run commands.
* Mixins must be declared ahead of time in the `mixins` section of the manifest.

---

```yaml
install: # action
  - exec: # step
      description: "Install my application"
      command: bash
      arguments:
        - install-myapp.sh
```

---
### Referencing files from the Manifest

We recommend referencing files using relative paths

## Step Outputs

* You tell the mixin what data to extract and put into an ouput
* Each mixin output will look different, but they all require a `name`
* Porter stores the output value, making it available to later steps
* Not all mixins support outputs

### Helm Mixin Output

```yaml
install:
- helm3:
    ...
    outputs:
    - name: mysql-password
      secret: mydb
      key: mysql-password

      wait: true
      outputs:
        - name: "IP_ADDRESS"

## Hot Wiring the Manifest

These variables are available for you to use in the manifest:

* bundle.name
* bundle.parameters.PARAMETER_NAME
* bundle.credentials.CREDENTIAL_NAME
* bundle.outputs.OUTPUT_NAME

---
name: templating

## Templating

Porter uses a template engine to substitute values into the manifest.

* Needs double quotes around the yaml entry
* Use double curly braces around the templated value

**Example**
```yaml
connectionString: ${bundle.outputs.host}:${bundle.outputs.port}
```

1. Using the helm mixin, install the latest **stable/etcd-operator** chart with the default values.
1. Build the bundle.
1. Generate credentials for your bundle.
1. Install your bundle.

## Installing Mixins

Anyone can make a mixin and have people install it using Porter

**porter mixin install terraform**

---

## What if I need a mixin that doesn't exist? üò∞

You can always use a custom dockerfile to install the tool you need and then
execute the commands with the exec mixin.

Custom mixins are just easier to use, but aren't necessary.

## What makes a mixin?

* Executable written in any language
* Communicates to Porter on stdin and stdout
* Supports a few commands: build, schema, install, upgrade, uninstall
* Translates the steps from the porter manifest to commands against any external tool or service

---
exclude: true
## What mixin would you make?

* Docker
* Google Cloud
* CloudFormation
* AWS
* Artifactory
* Vault
* Dominos üçï
* What else?

---
exclude: true
# Now run your bundle

* Run `porter install --reference [your new tag]`

Example tag of `cnabaholic/hello-people:latest`:

* Run `porter install --reference cnabaholic/hello-people:latest`

---
exclude: true
# How does it do that?

* Updates the bundle with the new images and digests
* Stores the bundle information as a combination:
  * OCI manifest list annotations to the main manifest list for the tag
  * A new manifest list for the bundle credentials and parameters.
* When pulling a bundle, it reconstructs it from the parts mentioned above

See [OCI Bundle Format](/oci-bundle-format) for an example.
