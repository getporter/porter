# What is CNAB?

.nudge[
> Cloud Native Application Bundles is an open-source packaging and distribution specification for managing distributed applications with a single installable file.
]

???

* goal: cloud installer
* don't worry, concrete later

---
# Where did it come from?

.nudge[

<img float="left" src="/images/logos/pivotal.png"/>
]

### We had contributions from other companies and the community! ❤️

---
# What does CNAB solve?

.nudge[
### The gap between your application's code and everything 
### necessary to deploy your application.
]

---
# Let's define an app

* Terraform to create the infrastructure
* Helm to deploy to a kubernetes cluster
* Obligatory bash script

???

* Doesn't have to be these technologies
* mix of infra, app and glue logic

---
# Let's find the gap

If I gave this to a friend to deploy, would they...
--

* Clone a repository? The app's or a devops one?
--

* Install specific versions of terraform and helm?
--

* Set environment variables, and save config files to specific locations?
--

* Use specific helm and terraform commands?
--

* Use a utility docker container that required them to mount volumes from the 
  local host and pass through environment variables?
--

* Guess all of this correctly... the first time? 😅
--

* How about at 2am while on-call for an app they didn't write? 😨
--

* Still be your friend? 🤔

# Get Set...

```
$ porter credentials create azure-tron.json
creating porter credential set in the current directory
$ cat azure-tron.json
# modify azure-tron.json with your editor to the content below
{
    "schemaType": "CredentialSet",
    "schemaVersion": "1.0.1",
    "name": "azure",
    "credentials": [
        {
            "name": "kubeconfig",
            "source": {
                "path": "/path/to/credential-path-file.txt"
            }
        },
    ]
}
$ porter credentials apply azure-tron.json
Applied /azure credential set
```

# Go!
```
$ porter install tron -t deislabs/tron:v1.0 --creds azure --param sparkles=true
```

---
# Let's Reflect
--

* Self describing, so it can tell you what you need to install it
--

* Installed with a single command
--

* Underlying toolsets and logic were abstracted in the bundle
--

* Distributed via OCI (Docker) registry
--

* You are still friends 😎

---
# What was in the bundle?

The application **and everything needed to install it**

* Helm and terraform CLIs
* Helm chart
* Terraform files
* Bash script that orchestrates installing everything

---

# Awkward Question Time!
--

## 🙋🏻‍♀️ Does this replace &lt; my favorite tech &gt;?
--

## 🙋🏻‍♀️ Why wouldn't I just use &lt; my favorite tech &gt;?
--

## 🙋🏻‍♀️ I don't like the sound of that bash script...

???

* Do you need to learn another tool?
* Do you need to hire someone who knows another tool?
* Are you in an environment that uses multiple tools, without a way to rapidly streamline the experience?

# When would you use a bundle?

---
# Include required tools

## Distribute files in the CNAB invocation image

.center[
  ![so what is it](/images/pack-your-bags/easy-bake-oven-image.png)
]

???

* Multiple tooled installations as a composed, logically structured unit. 
* Never hunting for the right client version

---

# Deploy App's Infrastructure

## Custom script for the invocation image entrypoint

.center[
  <img src="/images/porter-mixin-cloud.png" alt="helm, terraform, gcloud, azure logo cloud" width="400px" />
]

???
* DNS, load balancer, ssl certificat, CDN...
* Apps have baggage, state and deploying them is more than just code drops

---

# Airgapped Networks or Offline

## Thick bundles include referenced images

.center[
  <img src="/images/cnab-unpacked/usb-stick-cnab.svg" width="300px" />
]

???
* Features work both online and offline, including signatures and attestation validations. 

---

# Manage multiple tech stacks

## Consistent interface regardless horrors inside

.center[
  <img src="/images/cnab-unpacked/how-to-make-a-bundle.gif" alt="man packing suitcase with his foot" width="300px"/>
]

---

# Immutable, verified installer

## Signed bundles referencing image digests

.center[
  <img src="/images/cnab-unpacked/signed-bundle.svg" width="300px" />
]

???
* Each image and installation image has a digest to verify integrity. 
* Bundles can be signed, giving authority to the verification of images used. 
* Attestations can be attached, indicating that a bundle has achieved some state or possesses some approval from the supply chain.

# CNAB Sub Specifications

## Core
## Registries 🚧
## Security 🚧
## Dependencies 🚧

---
# Core Specification

* Invocation image format, aka "the installer"'
* Entrypoint in invocation images
* Bundle format (thin or thick)
* Bundle runtime execution behavior
* Well-known Actions
  * Install
  * Upgrade
  * Uninstall

# Anatomy of a Bundle

.center[
  ![so what is it](/images/pack-your-bags/anatomy.png)
]

---
# Application Images

* The same same docker images you use now
* Continue to build and distribute them without change
* CNAB doesn't affect this

---
# The Invocation Image

.center[
  **The Installer** or **MSI for the Cloud**
]

* Includes all the tools you need to install your app
* Has your configuration, metadata, templates, etc
* Run script with your logic for install, upgrade and uninstall

.center[
  <img src="/images/pack-your-bags/easy-bake-oven-image.png" width="275px" />
]

---
# The Bundle Descriptor

* **bundle.json**
* Invocation and Application images with their content digests
* Credentials and Parameters accepted by the installer
* Outputs generated by the installer

---
# Registries Specification

Push and pull bundles to OCI registries

.center[
  <img src="/images/pack-your-bags/share-bundles.png" alt="how oci shares bundles" width="600px" style="margin-top: 3rem;"/>
]

---
# Security Specification

* Image digests
* Signing bundles
* Bundle attestation

---
# Dependencies Specification

🚧 Very early stage 

* Require other bundles
* Specify their version
* Use their outputs

---
# CNAB Tooling

* Porter
* Docker App
* Duffle

Anyone can write their own too! These are all based on:

## 🙋🏻‍♀️ Are all CNAB tools interchangeable?

---
# Porter

The friendly cloud installer that bootstraps your bundles using tools and assets from your current pipeline. ✨

* Doesn't require knowledge of CNAB
* Uses mixins to include tools into bundles
* Designed to make bundles easier to create and manage
* Community focused

# Parting Awkward Questions
--

## 🙋🏻‍♀️ Is Porter a Microsoft-only tool?
--

## 🙋🏻‍♀️ Are bundles ready to use?
--

## 🙋🏻‍♀️ This is more of a comment really...
--

## 🙋🏻‍♀️ Ask me yours!
