# Understanding Cloud Native Application Bundles

## Abstract
Cloud Native Application Bundles, cnab.io, is an open-source package format specification for managing distributed applications with a single installable file. With bundles you can reliably provision application resources in different environments, and manage their application lifecycle, without having to use multiple toolsets.

The Cloud Native Application Specification, CNAB 1.0, was just released. A collaborative effort between Microsoft, Docker, Pivotal, and others.

Carolyn Van Slyck, the co-creator of Porter, the friendly cloud installer that gives you building blocks to create CNAB bundles from your existing pipeline, will demonstrate real world bundles, answering common questions:

* What is a bundle?
* When are bundles useful?
* Does this replace existing technology?
* Why wouldn't I just use helm, terraform, etc?
* Are all CNAB tools the same? Interchangeable?
