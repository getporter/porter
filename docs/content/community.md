## Forum

The best place to engage with the community is our [forum]. We prefer it over
Slack because people can more easily join in on conversations over time and find
answers to their questions.

<ul style="list-style:none;">
    <li>🙋🏽‍♀️ Ask questions</li>
    <li>💅🏽 Show off something you have created</li>
    <li>🖍 Collaborate with others on designs</li>
    <li>🧯 Troubleshoot something that you aren't sure is a bug yet</li>
    <li>👋🏾 Say "hi" and introduce yourself</li>
</ul>

Bug reports should still be GitHub issues. But for the rest, you can start here
and if it needs to be an issue, a maintainer will handle creating it and moving
the conversation over there.

## Mailing List

<p align="center">Join our <a href="https://groups.io/g/porter">mailing list</a></p>

* Watch for new releases of Porter
* Learn how to use new features
* Read blog posts about Porter and CNAB
* Discover and share best practices and see example bundles
* Hear about new mixins and plugins

## Slack

We have a **#porter** channel in the [CNCF Slack][slack]. You can [request an
invite][invite] to join.

<ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li>🗣 This is a good place to chat with other people about using Porter, developing
Porter mixins and plugins.</li>
    <li>🐞 This is not a good place to submit bug reports. Please 
    <a href="https://github.com/getporter/porter/issues/new">open an issue</a>
instead so that we don't miss it!</li>
</ul>

There is also a **#cnab** channel that is very active where people discuss the CNAB
spec, and work on upstream libraries such as cnab-go and docker-to-oci.

## Dev Meeting

We meet every other week to discuss [Porter Enhancement Proposals], demo new features and help other contributors. The agenda is open, anyone can edit to add an agenda item.
