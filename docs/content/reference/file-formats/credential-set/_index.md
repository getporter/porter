[Credential Sets](/credentials/) can be defined in either json or yaml.
You can use this [json schema][cs-schema] to validate a credential set file.

## Supported Versions

Below are schema versions for credential sets, and the corresponding Porter version that supports it.

| Schema Type   | Schema Version    | Porter Version   |
|---------------|-------------------|------------------|
| CredentialSet | (none)            | v0.38.*          |
| CredentialSet | [1.0.1](./1.0.1/) | v1.0.0-alpha.1+  |

Sometimes you may want to work with a different version of a resource than what is supported by Porter, especially when migrating from one version of Porter to another.
The [schema-check] configuration setting allows you to change how Porter behaves when the schemaVersion of a resource doesn't match Porter's supported version.
