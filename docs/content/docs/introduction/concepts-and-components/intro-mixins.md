Mixins make Porter special. They are the building blocks that you use when authoring bundles. Find them, use them, [create your own](/mixin-dev-guide/).

Mixins are adapters between the Porter and an existing tool or system. They know how to talk to Porter to include everything
they need to run, such as a CLI or config files, and how to execute their steps in the Porter manifest.

There are [many mixins](/mixins/) created by the Porter community.
Only the [exec mixin](/mixins/exec/) is installed by default.
