The Porter client is extensible and anyone can write a plugin to integrate with
Porter. Plugins extend the Porter client, reimplementing Porter's default
functionality.

For example, Porter saves installation data, credential sets and
parameter sets using the [mongodb-docker plugin], which is
suitable for development and testing. Porter also includes a [mongodb plugin],
which connects to a remote MongoDB server using a configured connection string,
which is intended for production use. You could write your own plugin to better
integrate with a MongoDB as a Server offering from your cloud provider.

[Plugins are very different from mixins][vs], which give you building blocks for
authoring bundles. There are a couple [types of plugins][types] and a single
plugin binary may contain multiple implementations.

# Available Plugins
