Porter is an implementation of the [Cloud Native Application Bundle](https://cnab.io/) specification and creates installers, known as bundles, that understand how to install not only your application but its infrastructure and configuration. A bundle helps you package up the logic for installing your application so that you can hand it off to another team, a customer, or just a co-worker who doesnâ€™t know all the ins and outs of your application and provide them a consistent installation experience that doesnâ€™t require them to know what tools you use to deploy or how the sausage is made.
