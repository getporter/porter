In this tutorial we will use the [Azure plugin][azure] to demonstrate how to
configure and use [plugins][plugins] with Porter. This allows us to manage
bundles as a team and resolve credentials from a secure secret store.

## Prerequisites

- A [Microsoft Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)
- [Install](/install/) Porter

## Create a storage account

Porter needs a blob storage account to store files.

1. On the Azure portal menu, select **All services**. In the list of resources, type **Storage Accounts**.

1. On the Storage Accounts window that appears, choose **Add**.

1. Under the Account kind field, select either **StorageV2 (general purpose v2)** or **BlobStorage**.

1. Select Review + Create to review your storage account settings and create the account.

1. Select **Create**.

## Create a container for Porter

Porter stores its data in a single blob storage container named "porter".

1. Navigate to your new storage account in the Azure portal.

1. In the left menu for the storage account, scroll to the **Blob service** section, then select **Containers**.

1. Select the **+ Container** button.

1. Type `porter` for the name of the new container. The name must be porter.

1. Leave the access level for the container to **Private (no anonymous access)**.

1. Click **OK** to create the container.

## Save the storage account connection string

Next we will save the connection string for the storage account.

1. Navigate to your new storage account in the Azure portal.

1. In the **Settings** section of the storage account overview, select **Access keys**. Your account access keys appear, as well as the complete connection string for each key.

1. Find the **Connection String** value under **key1**, and click the **Copy** button to copy the account key.

1. Define an environment variable `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` and set its value with the connection string from the previous step.

   **bash**

   ```
   export AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=***;AccountKey=***;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net"
   ```

   **powershell**

   ```
   $env:AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=***;AccountKey=***;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net"
   ```

## Create a key vault

1. From the Azure portal menu, select **Create a resource**. In the Search box, type **Key Vault**.

1. On the Key Vault section, choose **Create**.

1. For the tutorial we recommend using the same subscription, resource group and location that you used for the storage account.

1. Click **Create**.

## Add a secret

The bundle used in this tutorial retrieves a secret named "password" stored in this key vault.

1. Navigate to your new key vault in the Azure portal.

1. In the left menu for the storage account, scroll to the **Settings** section and then select **Secrets**.

1. Select the **+ Generate/Import** button.

1. Set the **Name** of the secret to `password`.

1. Set the **Value** of the secret to any value, for example `TopSecret!`. The value itself is not important for this tutorial, only that a value is set.

1. Leave the other fields with their default values.

1. Click **Create**.

## Create a service principal

Now we will create a service principal and give it access to our key vault.

1. From the Azure portal menu, select **Create a resource**. In the Search box, type **Azure Active Directory**.

1. Next select **App registrations**, then **+ New registration**.

1. Name your application **porter-plugin-tutorial**.

1. Leave the other fields with their default values.

1. Click **Register**.

1. On the app registration page, note the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**, and then define environment variables for them:

   **bash**

   ```
   export AZURE_CLIENT_ID="<APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID>"
   export AZURE_TENANT_ID="<DIRECTORY_TENANT_ID>"
   ```

   **powershell**

   ```
   $env:AZURE_CLIENT_ID="<APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID>"
   $env:AZURE_TENANT_ID="<DIRECTORY_TENANT_ID>"
   ```

1. In the left menu for the app registration, scroll to the **Manage** section and select **Certificates & secrets**.

1. Under **Client secrets** click **+ New client secret**.

1. Leave the fields with their default values.

1. Click **Add**.

1. Copy the generated client secret and define an environment variable for it:

   **bash**

   ```
   export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="<CLIENT_SECRET>"
   ```

   **powershell**

   ```
   $env:AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="<CLIENT_SECRET>"
   ```

## Configure permissions on key vault

<img src="/images/plugin-tutorial/create-access-policy.png" align="right" width="300px" />

1. Navigate to your new key vault in the Azure portal.

1. In the **Settings** section of the key vault overview, select **Access policies**.

1. Click **+ Add Access Policy**.

1. In the **Secret Permissions** field select **Get**.

1. In the **Select principal** field, select the service principal created in the previous section.

1. Leave the other fields with their default values.

1. Click **Add**.

## Configure Porter to use the plugin

Now that we have all the data the plugin would need to connect to our cloud
resources, the last step is to update Porter's configuration, so it uses the
plugin.

1. Open or create `~/.porter/config.yaml`.

1. Add the following line to activate the Azure blob storage plugin:

   ```yaml
   default-storage-plugin: "azure.blob"
   ```

1. Add the following lines to activate and configure the Azure keyvault secrets
   plugin. Replace `myvault` with the name of the Key Vault that you created
   earlier.

   ```yaml
   default-secrets: "mysecrets"

   secrets:
     name: "mysecrets"
     plugin: "azure.keyvault"
     config:
       vault: "myvault"
   ```

## Try it out

Let's try out Porter with the plugin activated and see it in action!

```console
$ porter list
NAME           CREATED      MODIFIED     LAST ACTION   LAST STATUS
```

If you had previously installed bundles before, you won't see them anymore
because porter is using the plugin to list bundles from the storage account. So
let's install another bundle and have it saved to the cloud.

We will use the `ghcr.io/getporter/examples/plugins-tutorial:v0.2.0` bundle, let's use `porter
explain` to see what credentials are necessary.

```console
$ porter explain ghcr.io/getporter/examples/plugins-tutorial:v0.2.0
Name: plugins-tutorial
Description: Example of porter resolving credentials from a secrets store using a plugin.
This bundle is a companion for the plugin tutorial at https://porter.sh/plugins/tutorial/.
Version: 0.1.0

Credentials:
Name       Description                                                                         Required
password   Password for installing the world. We recommend getting this from a secret store.   true
```

Since the bundle needs a credential, let's generate it using `porter credentials` command.
First, run `porter credentials create <file-name>` to generate the template file.
Then, edit the file to include required credentials and set the source for its value.
Lastly, run `porter credentials apply <file-name>` to generate the credential set.

```console
$ porter credentials create plugins-tutorial.json
creating porter credential set in the current directory
$ cat plugins-tutorial.json
# modify plugins-tutorial.json with your editor to the content below
{
    "schemaType": "CredentialSet",
    "schemaVersion": "1.0.1",
    "name": "plugins-tutorial",
    "credentials": [
        {
            "name": "password",
            "source": {
                "secret": "password"
            }
        }
    ]
}
$ porter credentials apply plugins-tutorial.json
Applied /plugins-tutorial credential set
```

For more information on how to use `porter credentials` commands, take a look at our [credentials quickstart guide](/quickstart/credentials).

Now we are ready to install the bundle and pass it our generated credentials. ðŸŽ‰
Porter is using the Azure plugin to inject the password credential from Azure
Key Vault into the bundle during install.

```console
$ porter install --reference ghcr.io/getporter/examples/plugins-tutorial:v0.2.0 -c plugins-tutorial
installing plugins-tutorial...
executing install action from plugins-tutorial (installation: plugins-tutorial)
Install World
Using Magic Password: *******
execution completed successfully!
```

The installation is recorded in Azure Blob Storage and read back out again
by the Azure plugin when we run `porter list`.

```
$ porter list
NAME                CREATED          MODIFIED         LAST ACTION   LAST STATUS
plugins-tutorial    51 seconds ago   49 seconds ago   install       success
```

Now the installation of the plugins-tutorial bundle is saved in the cloud and
shared with the rest of our team. A co-worker using the same configuration will
see the same list of bundles that we do, and can perform further actions on the
bundles. Go team! ðŸ™Œ
