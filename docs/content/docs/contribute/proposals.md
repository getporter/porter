Is there something about Porter that you would like to change? Let us know! We
have a process that allows anyone to suggest a change, have the maintainers and
community weigh in, and when there is consensus implement it.

Our [Porter Enhancement Proposal][pep] (PEP) walks you through how to share
your idea and turn it into a proposal.
