title: Porter Plugins File Format 1.0.0
description: The 1.0.0 file format for Porter plugin installation files
layout: single

The plugins file is used when installing multiple plugins at the same time with the [porter plugins install](/cli/porter_plugins_install/) command.
Plugins can be defined in either json or yaml.
You can use this [json schema][plugins-schema] to validate a plugins config file.

## Supported Versions

Below are schema versions for plugin installation files, and the corresponding Porter version that supports it.

| Schema Type | Schema Version | Porter Version |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| Plugins     | 1.0.0          | v1.0.6         |

Sometimes you may want to work with a different version of a resource than what is supported by Porter, especially when migrating from one version of Porter to another.
The [schema-check] configuration setting allows you to change how Porter behaves when the schemaVersion of a resource doesn't match Porter's supported version.
