title: Porter CredentialSet File Format 1.0.1
description: The 1.0.1 file format for Porter CredentialSet resources
---

[Credential Sets](/credentials/) can be defined in either json or yaml.
You can use this [json schema][cs-schema] to validate a credential set file.

## Changes

The created and modified fields were moved under the CredentialSet status field. They cannot be set manually.

## Example

```yaml
schemaType: CredentialSet
schemaVersion: 1.0.1
name: mycreds
namespace: staging
labels:
  team: redteam
  owner: xianglu
credentials:
  - name: token
    source:
      env: GITHUB_TOKEN
  - name: kubeconfig
    source:
      path: $HOME/.kube/config
  - name: connStr
    source:
      secret: my-connection-string
```
