## porter mixins feed generate

Generate an atom feed from the mixins in a directory

### Synopsis

Generate an atom feed from the mixins in a directory. 

A template is required, providing values for text properties such as the author name, base URLs and other values that cannot be inferred from the mixin file names. You can make a default template by running 'porter mixins feed template'.

The file names of the mixins must follow the naming conventions required of published mixins:

VERSION/MIXIN-GOOS-GOARCH[FILE_EXT]

More than one mixin may be present in the directory, and the directories may be nested a few levels deep, as long as the file path ends with the above naming convention, porter will find and match it. Below is an example directory structure that porter can list to generate a feed:

```
bin/
└── v1.2.3/
    ├── mymixin-darwin-amd64
    ├── mymixin-linux-amd64
    └── mymixin-windows-amd64.exe
```

See https://getporter.org/development/dist-a-mixin/ more details.
