Copy a bundle

### Synopsis

Copy a published bundle from one registry to another.		
Source bundle can be either a tagged reference or a digest reference.
Destination can be either a registry, a registry/repository, or a fully tagged bundle reference. 
If the source bundle is a digest reference, destination must be a tagged reference.
