## porter installations apply

Apply changes to an installation

### Synopsis

Apply changes from the specified file to an installation. If the installation doesn't already exist, it is created.
The installation's bundle is automatically executed if changes are detected.

When the namespace is not set in the file, the current namespace is used.

You can use the show command to create the initial file:
  porter installation show mybuns --output yaml > mybuns.yaml


```
porter installations apply FILE [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  porter installation apply myapp.yaml
  porter installation apply myapp.yaml --dry-run
  porter installation apply myapp.yaml --force
```

### Options

      --dry-run            Evaluate if the bundle would be executed based on the changes in the file.
      --force              Force the bundle to be executed when no changes are detected.
