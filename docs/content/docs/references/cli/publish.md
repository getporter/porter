## porter publish

Publish a bundle

### Synopsis

Publishes a bundle by pushing the invocation image and bundle to a registry.

Note: if overrides for registry/tag/reference are provided, this command only re-tags the invocation image and bundle; it does not re-build the bundle.

```
porter publish [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  porter publish
  porter publish --file myapp/porter.yaml
  porter publish --dir myapp
  porter publish --archive /tmp/mybuns.tgz --reference myrepo/my-buns:0.1.0
  porter publish --tag latest
  porter publish --registry myregistry.com/myorg
  porter publish --autobuild-disabled
		
```

  -d, --dir string           Path to the build context directory where all bundle assets are located.
  -f, --file porter.yaml     Path to the Porter manifest. Defaults to porter.yaml in the current directory.
      --force                Force push the bundle to overwrite the previously published bundle
  -h, --help                 help for publish
      --insecure-registry    Don't require TLS for the registry
  -r, --reference string     Use a bundle in an OCI registry specified by the given reference.
      --registry string      Override the registry portion of the bundle reference, e.g. docker.io, myregistry.com/myorg
      --tag string           Override the Docker tag portion of the bundle reference, e.g. latest, v0.1.1
```

Most commands require a Docker daemon, either local or remote.
