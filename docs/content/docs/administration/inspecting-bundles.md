You've found a bundle that you'd like to use, but you'd like to what images will be used after you install the bundle. You can use the `porter inspect` command to see this information. If you'd like to see additional information, like parameters, credentials, and outputs, see the [explain](/operations/examine-bundles/) command.

When a bundle is published, the images that it will use are copied into the location of the published bundle. This simplifies access control and management of artifacts in the repository. The `inspect` command will show the invocation images, as well as any referenced images, that will be used as a result of performing actions like install nad upgrade. For each image, you will see the image reference that will be used, along with the original image reference that the image was copied from.

```console
$ porter inspect jeremyrickard/porter-do-bundle:v1.0.0
Name: spring-music
Description: Run the Spring Music Service on Kubernetes and Digital Ocean PostgreSQL
Version: 1.0.0

Invocation Images:

```

With the image information above, you can use existing tooling to pull, inspect and vet the images before you run the bundle. If you copy or archive and then republish a bundle, the image information will reflect the new locations of the images, allowing you to compare between the source and the new bundle as well. This is especially useful when used with bundles that have been re-published from an archive:

```console
$ porter inspect jrrporter.azurecr.io/do-porter-from-archive:1.0.0
Name: spring-music
Description: Run the Spring Music Service on Kubernetes and Digital Ocean PostgreSQL
Version: 1.0.0

Invocation Images:

```

Here, we can see the original image reference and our newly created archive reference. We can compare the two in order to ensure that they are indeed the same.

`porter inspect` can be used with a published bundle, as show above, or with a local bundle. The command even works with bundles that were not built with Porter, through the use of the `--cnab-file` flag. You can view the output in tabular form, as above, JSON or YAML. For all the options, run the command `porter inspect --help`.
