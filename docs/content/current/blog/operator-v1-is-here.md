Porter Operator v1.0.0 is finally here! ðŸŽ‰

## What is the Porter Operator?

The Porter Operator gives you a native, integrated experience for managing your bundles from Kubernetes. It is the recommended way to automate your bundle pipeline with support for GitOps.

## What's new in v1?


### Outputs
ðŸš¨ Outputs is currently WIP, we will be following up shortly with the 
ability for outputs to work after an installation upgrade.


Our biggest feature by far is the Outputs API. Being able to share outputs between bundles,
services, and allow users to retrieve outputs from bundles is a must have. By creating the
`installation.outputs` CRD we are now able to expose those outputs. We leverage the work done
in Porter to turn a gRPC server which enables for these outputs to be shared for a variety of
use cases. 

### Delete all the things!

There were a myriad of issues we were running into when trying to delete resources. One of these issues being that a finalizer would block the deletion of a namespace. By updating one of our reconcilers to check that a deletion timestamp was set, the deletion of namespaces which have operator resources is now able to occur.

The `TTLSecondsAfterFinished` agent configuration option is out, which allows users to set the time limit of a job that has finished its execution. This defaults to 600 seconds, but in the long term should allow for easier debugging.
