When [Jeremy Rickard][jerrycar] and I created Porter less than two years ago, we
wanted to create a community-led project that would encourage collaboration
across vendors to make Cloud Native Application Bundles ([CNAB]) accessible and
maintainable. We want to continue to support that mission of vendor neutral
independence while growing the community of practitioners who can use and
contribute to Porter's development.

Today, the Porter Maintainers are happy to announce that Porter has been accepted
as a CNCF Sandbox project. By contributing Porter to the CNCF, we hope to
encourage the adoption of Porter to ease the creation and use of bundles and to
see more companies contribute mixins.

In the near-term, we are focusing on our [roadmap]. Our introductory
documentation will be expanded and restructured to make it easier to get started
with Porter and bundles. We have also been collecting feedback from the
community on various usability points in Porter, for example how to build and
promote bundles in a CI pipeline or use template variables in the Porter
manifest, and we will begin addressing these items to make Porter easier to use
and automate.

In addition to contributing ideas and energy to those initiatives, developers
can contribute mixins by following our [Mixin Development
Guide][mixin-dev-guide]. Examples of mixins include the [Docker Mixin][docker]
and [Terraform Mixin][terraform].

Community][community] and [contribute to the project][contribute].
