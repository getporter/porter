    Setting up your Porter environment with your required plugins using the new `--file` flag with `porter plugins install` command.
---

### Breaking change
The recent porter v1.0.5 release introduced a new flag `--file` on `porter plugins install` command. Its intention is to allow users to install multiple plugins through a plugins definition file with a single porter command. However, it did not work as expected due to bad file format.

The fix that contains the correct schema has been published with a new v1.0.6 release. If you have an existing plugins file, please update it to work with v1.0.6+.

### Install multiple plugins with a single command
Now, you can install multiple plugins using a plugin definition yaml file like below:
```yaml
schemaType: Plugins
schemaVersion: 1.0.0
plugins:
  azure:
    version: v1.0.1
  kubernetes:
    version: v1.0.1
```

After creating the file, you can run the command:
```bash
porter plugins install -f <path-to-the-file>
```

The output from the command should look like this:
```
installed azure plugin v1.0.1 (e361abc)
installed kubernetes plugin v1.0.1 (f01c944)
```

Make sure to update your current plugins schema file to the [latest format](/reference/file-formats/#plugins)
