# Porter is a Cloud Installer

Porter gives you the building blocks to create a cloud installer for your
application, handling all the necessary infrastructure and configuration setup.
It is based on the Cloud Native Application Bundle Specification
([CNAB](https://deislabs.io/cnab)). Porter provides a declarative authoring
experience that lets you focus on what you know best: your application.

# Roadmap

Porter is an open-source project and things get done as quickly as we have
motivated contributors working on features that interest them. 😉

The roadmap represents what the core maintainers have said that they are
currently working on and plan to work on over the next few months. We use the
"on-hold" bucket to communicate items of interest that doesn't have a core
maintainer who will be working on it.
